# Inheritance-in-ML-projects
implements several ML models which have their own preprocessing algorithm on the same dataset.<br>

This repo was inspired by article '<i>Learn how to implement coding best practices to avoid tech debts</i>'
by  Marcello Politi - Published in  Towards Data Science Nov 21, 2024.<br><br>

The article describes OOP approach towards inheritance in ML projects. It depicts LogisticRegressionModel and RandomForestModel classes.  The 
aim of this repository is to extend this effort to the following models:<br>
**1. Linear Models**<br>
•	Logistic Regression<br>
•	Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)<br>
**2. Tree-Based Models**<br>
•	Decision Trees<br>
•	Random Forest<br>
•	Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)<br>
**3. Ensemble Methods**<br>
•	Bagging Classifier<br>
•	AdaBoost<br>
**4. Support Vector Machines**<br>
•	SVM with Linear Kernel<br>
•	SVM with RBF Kernel<br>
•	SVM with Polynomial Kernel<br>
5. k-Nearest Neighbors<br>
•	k-NN (with varying values of k)<br>
**6. Neural Networks**<br>
•	Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)<br>
7. Naive Bayes<br>
•	Gaussian Naive Bayes<br>
•	Bernoulli Naive Bayes (less relevant due to numeric features)<br>
8. Clustering Models (For Unsupervised Analysis)<br>
•	k-Means<br>
•	DBSCAN<br>
•	Agglomerative Clustering<br>
9. Probabilistic Models<br>
•	Bayesian Networks<br>
**10. Dimensionality Reduction**<br>
(Not predictive models but helpful for visualization and preprocessing)<br>
•	PCA (Principal Component Analysis)<br>
•	t-SNE<br><br>This is a lot of ground to cover. It will tke time but I started with addition of <i>Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)</i> Please bear with me.
