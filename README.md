# Inheritance-in-ML-projects
implements several ML models which have their own preprocessing algorithm on the same dataset.<br>

This repo was inspired by article '<i>Learn how to implement coding best practices to avoid tech debts</i>'
by  Marcello Politi - Published in  Towards Data Science Nov 21, 2024.<br><br>

The article describes OOP approach towards inheritance in ML projects. It depicts LogisticRegressionModel and RandomForestModel classes.  The 
aim of this repository is to  1) extend this effort to other models  2) use different datasets with varying complexities to understand effect on performance. 3) define additional abstract class to plot charts for clarity when and if is needed.  The additional models are: <br>
**1. Linear Models**<br>
•	Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)<br>
**2. Tree-Based Models**<br>
•	Decision Trees<br>
•	Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)<br>
**3. Ensemble Methods**<br>
•	Bagging Classifier<br>
•	AdaBoost<br>
**4. Support Vector Machines**<br>
•	SVM with Linear Kernel<br>
•	SVM with RBF Kernel<br>
•	SVM with Polynomial Kernel<br>
5. k-Nearest Neighbors<br>
•	k-NN (with varying values of k)<br>
**6. Neural Networks**<br>
•	Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)<br>
7. Naive Bayes<br>
•	Gaussian Naive Bayes<br>
•	Bernoulli Naive Bayes (less relevant due to numeric features)<br>
8. Clustering Models (For Unsupervised Analysis)<br>
•	k-Means<br>
•	DBSCAN<br>
•	Agglomerative Clustering<br>
9. Probabilistic Models<br>
•	Bayesian Networks<br>
**10. Dimensionality Reduction**<br>
(Not predictive models but helpful for visualization and preprocessing)<br>
•	PCA (Principal Component Analysis)<br>
•	t-SNE<br><br>This is a lot of ground to cover. It will tke time but I started with addition of <i>Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)</i> Please bear with me.
